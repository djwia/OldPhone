    - The jagged array for the input and output mapping can be improved by setting the values
      in a config file or by using a different data structure like Hashmap (Dictionary).
    - The *, 0, # symbols can also be included in the jagged array if they were needed.
    - Since the inputs and outputs are fairly consistent they were included in the program.
    - The main purpose of the program is to be fast and concise.
    - To make it a responsive application, while(true) loop can be introduced to fetch input from 
      the user and write the output.
